# binomial-classification-glm
The primary goal for this project is to classify single variable polynomials as an odd degree or even degree using logistic regression. The given dataset contains 1000 sampled polynomials with max and minimum ranging between -5 and 5 at equal intervals of 0.05. It also contains 201 columns spreading from x1 to x201 and the labels associated with these sampled polynomials are available in ‘odd_degree’ column with values as 0’s and 1’s. Where 0’s indicate that the polynomial is an odd value and 1’s indicate that the polynomial is an even. Analysis includes the identification of the features of the model that may be important to make the classification. We will also implement model performance evaluation using ROC curve and AUC tools.
